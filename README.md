# Jeopardy Scraper

James Holzhauer has been on a Streak of continually winning Jeopardy. There is a site called [TheJeopardyFan.com](https://thejeopardyfan.com/) that blogs results of Jeopardy games.

I wrote a simple script using Puppeteer to extract data from the site including the current day's winnings, current streak, and total winnings for James.

There are plenty of kinks in the scraper currently such as if James does not play a day for some event on Jeopardy or if the blog post hasn't been published that day. This will be improved over time.
